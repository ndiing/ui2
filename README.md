# UI2 Framework

UI2 is an advanced UI framework meticulously designed to adhere to Material Design 3 guidelines. Leveraging the power of Node.js, Webpack, and LitElement, UI2 offers developers a comprehensive toolkit for crafting modern, visually captivating user interfaces.

## Key Features

- **Modern Development Stack:** Built with Node.js, Webpack, and LitElement, ensuring efficient development and bundling of resources.
- **Organized Structure:** Resources are neatly organized within the `./src` folder, while components reside in the `./src/com` directory, promoting clarity and maintainability.
- **Material Design 3 Compliant:** UI2 components strictly follow Material Design 3 guidelines, guaranteeing consistency and familiarity for end-users.

## Getting Started

To seamlessly integrate UI2 into your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/ndiing/ui2.git
</pre>

2. **Install Dependencies:**

<pre>
npm install
</pre>

3. **Start the Development Server:**

<pre>
npm start
</pre>

This command launches the development server, providing an optimal environment for developing and testing UI components.

## Usage

UI2 offers an extensive collection of components designed to align seamlessly with Material Design 3 principles. Components are developed following LitElement patterns for creating web components. To incorporate a component into your project, simply import it as follows:

<pre>
import { MdButton, MdCard, MdTextField } from 'ui2';
</pre>

Then, integrate the component into your UI using LitElement patterns:

<pre>
class MyComponent extends LitElement {
  render() {
    return html`
      <div>
        <md-button label="Click me" @click="${this.handleClick}"></md-button>
        <md-card>
          <md-text-field label="Username"></md-text-field>
        </md-card>
      </div>
    `;
  }

  handleClick() {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  }
}
</pre>

For comprehensive documentation on each component and its respective properties, refer to the documentation available in the `./docs` folder.
